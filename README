These are all independent .pde files intended to be "compiled" as a 
Processing sketch (program) named "Luma".

How to compile:
1:  Download and familiarize yourself with Processing. --> http:\\www.processing.org

2:  Once you are comfortable (shouldn't take long) create a new sketch 
    called "LUMA" and save it.

3:  Close Processing.

4:  Go to the folder that was created in saving the sketch, and dump all the 
    files in this repository(other than the readme)as plain text with the 
    extension *.pde into that folder. Overwrite the old Luma.pde.

5:  Reopen Processing and reopen the Luma sketch. You should notice that you 
    have a bazillion tabs now. That's because Processing doesn't really have 
    line numbers built into its IDE. Furthermore, it doesn't have much of anything.

6:  Go to my server space and download Lumashits.zip. Unzip the enclosed folder named data
    right next to all those *.pde files.

7:  Press the little play button in the Processing IDE. Luma should run.

*Note: If you REALLY hate the Processing IDE, you can use the "use external editor" option.
*Note: Since you grew up on better stuff than this, you REALLY should hate it.
